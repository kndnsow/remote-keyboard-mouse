## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the server running on your Windows PC.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Windows 10 or 11.
-   Python 3.9+ installed. Make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
-   Your PC and mobile phone must be connected to the **same Wi-Fi network**.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kndnsow/remote-keyboard-mouse.git
cd remote-keyboard-mouse
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file. See the section below.)*

### 4. Generate SSL Certificate

For the secure `HTTPS` connection to work, you need to generate a self-signed certificate. Open a command prompt in the project directory and run:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
```
You can press Enter to accept the default values for all prompts. This will create `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.

### 5. Run the Application

You can now start the server by running the `app.py` script:

```bash
python app.py
```
A new icon will appear in your system tray. The server is now running!

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Connect Your Phone**: Right-click the tray icon on your PC and select "Show QR Code".
2.  **Scan**: Use your phone's camera to scan the QR code that appears on your screen.
3.  **Trust the Connection**: Your mobile browser will show a security warning because the SSL certificate is self-signed. This is expected and safe. Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to [your IP address]".
4.  **Control Your PC**: The remote control interface will load. You can now use the touchpad, air mouse, keyboard, and media controls.

## üèóÔ∏è Building a Standalone `.exe`

For ultimate portability, you can compile the entire application into a single `.exe` file that can be run on any Windows PC without needing Python installed.

### 1. Install PyInstaller

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Build the Executable

Open a command prompt in the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=static/icon.ico --add-data "index.html;." --add-data "settings.html;." --add-data "cert.pem;." --add-data "key.pem;." --add-data "static;static" app.py
```
This command bundles everything‚Äîyour script, web files, icon, and SSL certificates‚Äîinto one package.

### 3. Run Your App

Navigate to the `dist` folder. Inside, you will find **`app.exe`**. This is your complete, standalone remote control server. You can rename it and move it anywhere!

## Creating the `requirements.txt` File

For the setup instructions to work, create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project's root directory and add the following lines:

```
Flask
pyautogui
pystray
Pillow
qrcode
pynput
pywin32
```
